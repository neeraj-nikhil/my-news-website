                <h2>Supreme Court upholds the abrogation of Article 370, says it is a ‘temporary provision’</h2>
                <p>A Constitution Bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) D.Y. Chandrachud on Monday unanimously upheld the Central government’s 2019 decision to abrogate Article 370 of the Constitution which conferred special status on the erstwhile State of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K).
                    Pointing out that Article 370 is a ‘temporary provision’, the Bench said that it was enacted due to wartime conditions in the State and was meant to serve a transitional purpose. 
                    The court held that J&K did not retain any internal sovereignty after its integration and that the concurrence of the State Government was not required to apply the Indian Constitution to the State.
                    In light of Solicitor General Tushar Mehta’s submission that the government plans to restore J&K’s statehood as soon as possible, the court did not adjudicate upon the validity of the reorganisation of the State into the Union Territories of J&K and Ladakh . 
                    However, it upheld the carving out of Ladakh as a Union Territory. <br>
                    The court also directed the Election Commission of India to take steps to conduct elections to the J&K Legislative Assembly by September 30, 2024.

                <h2>How can IIT Kanpur's ‘artificial rain’ help curb Delhi pollution issue? Explained</h2>
                <p>Over the past few days, the pollution in Delhi has been worsening, causing significant problems for its residents and shrouding other parts of northern India, including cities in Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, and more, in a toxic haze. As of 5 pm on Wednesday, the air quality index (AQI) in Delhi stood at a 'very poor' level of 398.
                   <br>To address this issue, the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur has proposed the idea of "artificial rain" to reduce pollution levels in the national capital. 
                   This project has been in development since 2018, and the institute conducted trials in July of this year, as reported by the Economic Times. 
                   The researchers have secured the necessary permissions from government authorities, including the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), to carry out cloud seeding for this purpose.

                <h2>Retail inflation at 3-month high of 5.55% in November</h2>
                <p>India's retail inflation rose to 5.55% in November from 4.87% in October due to higher food prices, according to government data. 
                   The figures are within the Reserve Bank of India's comfort zone. Inflation had been declining since August. 
                   The rate of price rise in the food basket was 8.7% in November. The RBI projected the CPI inflation at 5.4% for 2023-24. 
                   The inflation had peaked at 7.44% in July this year amid soaring prices of vegetables during the monsoon season. Since then, it has steadily declined.</p>
                   The Reserve Bank of India has been tasked by the government to ensure retail inflation remains at 4 per cent with a margin of 2 per cent on either side.
                   In the monetary policy announced last week, the RBI projected the CPI inflation at 5.4 per cent for 2023-24, with a reading of 5.6 per cent in the third quarter and 5.2 per cent in the last quarter.
